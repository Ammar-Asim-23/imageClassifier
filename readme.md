"Image Classifier Project with TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn"

This project aims to develop an image classifier using both TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn libraries. The project includes preprocessing and visualizing image data, building and training models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and tree ensemble techniques, and optimizing model performance. Git Large File Storage (LFS) is utilized to handle large model files efficiently. The project showcases a comprehensive approach to creating accurate image classifiers while employing modern tools and techniques.
